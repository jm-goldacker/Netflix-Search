# Netflix-Search
With this tool you are able to search the Netflix database for movies and series. It uses the uNoGS API (https://rapidapi.com/unogs/api/unogs). 

To compile the source code you need Elm 0.18 (https://elm-lang.org/) and an API-key for uNoGS (https://rapidapi.com/unogs/api/unogs). Replace the string "Insert your key here" inside the Main.elm-file with your key.
