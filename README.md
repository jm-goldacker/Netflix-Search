# Netflix-Search

With this tool you are able to search the Netflix database for movies and series. I created this for a Elm course at my university.
It uses the uNoGS API (https://rapidapi.com/unogs/api/unogs). 

To compile the source code you need Elm 0.18 (https://elm-lang.org/) and an API-key for uNoGS (https://rapidapi.com/unogs/api/unogs). Replace the string "Insert your key here" inside the Main.elm-file with your key.

Under https://jm-goldacker.github.io/Netflix-Search/ you can look at the web app. You are not able to perform searches, because too many searches would cost me money.
